    "A major motivation for animal scanning is in translational work where the same protocols can be used to match clinical studies. Differences in scale and morphology between species often mean though that optimal acquisition requires some careful thought. This is particularly acute where the data are to be used for computational neuroanatomy analysis. In this talk I will discuss some of the challenges inherent in scanning the animal brain and how to optimise protocols to maximise the potential for automated analysis of the data.  "
